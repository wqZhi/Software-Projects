I created sys methods in sysproc.c: settickets, getpinfo, mprotect, munprotect. These methods in sysproc.c will call its own methods in proc.c | vm.c and do the edge case checking and function implenment. settickets will help every process set its ticket value, could be 1 or 0 depends on the process. If the process doesn't have ticket value, then the settickets will give it a default value 1. getpinfo will help return and assign the pid information for each created process object. Also, in proc.c file, I modified the scheduler which make it can work base on the p.tickets priority level and logic implemention. For the VM part, I create major mprotect and munprotect code function in vm.c, this two methods perform readable and writeable features which most of their code are overlaped besides that. To avoid null pointer dereference, I modified Makefile, exec.c, vm.c and change the entrypoint to 0x1000 in Makefile.
