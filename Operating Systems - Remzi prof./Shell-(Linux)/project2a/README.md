My code has batch mode and interactive mode, and executes different modes by judging the arguments passed in the main argument. in reading user commands, the program has the ability to handle both built-in and non-built-in commands like ls, if. By cutting the text string, access verification is performed and given to execv for further execution and control of subroutines such as closing and getting results. It is possible to keep the program open and have the ability to detect exceptions and close the program by looping continuously.
