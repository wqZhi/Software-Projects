The program has both batch and interactive modes, determined by the arguments passed to the main function. It can handle both built-in and non-built-in commands, such as ls and if, by parsing the user input. Verification is performed before executing the commands using execv. The program continues to run, with the ability to detect exceptions and gracefully close, through a continuous loop.
