<p>Quaternions are usually not a topic discussed in an introductory graphics course - but they are an important topic that gets a lot of discussion in graphics more generally. We want to give you the basic idea for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The basic idea isn&rsquo;t that much different than Axis Angle, which you should understand as part of a graphics class. If you have this idea, Quaternions won&rsquo;t seem so magical.</li>
<li>Internally, this is how THREE.js works. You can see this in the <a href="https://cs559.github.io/ThreeDocs_r137/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Matrix-transformations" target="_blank">matrix transformations</a>. THREE does a great job of hiding the fact that it always stores rotations as quaternions - it does the conversions as necessary.</li>
<li>Increasingly, Quaternions are the <em>de facto</em> preferred choice for representing rotation in graphics and other fields (like robotics).</li>
</ol>
<p>Quaternions are 4-dimensional complex numbers. Technically, in computer graphics we deal with <strong>Unit Quaternions</strong> which are Quaternions (4 numbers) that have unit magnitude. Unit Quaternions can be used to represent rotations.</p>
<h2 id="from-axis-angle-to-quaternions">From Axis Angle to Quaternions</h2>
<p>On the last page, we saw how nice Axis Angle representations are for getting nice rotations. Unlike Euler Angles, Axis Angle representations require us to store 4 numbers to represent a rotation (3 for the axis, 1 for the angle).</p>
<p>The problem with Axis Angle representation is that there are some things we don&rsquo;t know how to do with them. The biggest one: If we have two Axis Angle rotations, we don&rsquo;t know how to compose them into a single Axis Angle rotation (if the axes are different - if the axes are the same, we can just add the angles). Also, figuring out how to &ldquo;apply&rdquo; the rotation to a point (either doing the transformation directly, or converting it to a matrix) is a lot of work.</p>
<p>Euler Angles have these same problems (but might be worse for both).</p>
<p>But with axis angles, there is a simple trick.</p>
<p>Suppose our axis angle representation is <code>$ \theta, \mathbf{\hat{v}} $</code> so <code>$ \theta $</code> is the angle and <code>$ \mathbf{\hat{v}} $</code> is the unit vector of the axis (we can always normalize the axis to get a unit vector).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll create a new set of 4 numbers (one scalar and a 3-vector):</p>
<p><code>$ \cos{\frac{\theta}{2}},\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}\mathbf{\hat{v}} $</code></p>
<p>All we did was replace <code>$\theta$</code> by <code>$\cos{\frac{\theta}{2}}$</code> and scaled the vector (<code>$\mathbf{\hat{v}}$</code>) by <code>$\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}$</code>.</p>
<p>Remembering some high school trigonometry, <code>$\cos^2{\alpha}+\sin^2{\alpha}=1$</code> we can see that this new version of the 4 numbers is going to have magnitude one.</p>
<p>Now, you might wonder &ldquo;of all the different things we could have done to the 4 numbers of axis angle, why would we ever scale by the sin of the half angle?&rdquo; Sorry, but the answer is way beyond what we&rsquo;ll study in an introductory graphics class.</p>
<p>But, if you do this non-obvious change, something special happens: we have encoded the rotation as a <strong>unit quaternion.</strong> A unit quaternion is, in one sense, just a set of 4 numbers that have magnitude one. So our scaling change does create one. And once we have a unit quaternion, there are all kinds of things we can do with them because they have a well-defined algebra.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to learn how to <strong>use</strong> quaternions, you can look at a graphics book (such as section 3 of <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/files/23924293/download?download_frd=1">RTR4_Ch04.pdf (68.2mb)</a> - this reading is optional) and see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit Quaternions can be multiplied together easily. This lets us compose rotations.</li>
<li>If you have two Unit Quaternions you can interpolate between them using <em>spherical linear interpolation</em> (or <strong>slerp</strong> for short - yes, that is the term graphics people use).</li>
<li>For almost everything you need to do with a rotation in computer graphics, there is an efficient and elegant way to do it with Unit Quaternions.</li>
<li>The math behind Quaternions has to do with high-dimensional complex numbers, so it sounds really fancy. It is quite elegant.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for these reasons, THREE.js (and many other systems) use Unit Quaternions internally for representing rotations. Fortunately, in THREE, they hide the internals well, so you never have to see a Quaternion. You can work with Euler Angles or Axis Angle representations, and it will get converted back and forth as needed.</p>
<p>For class, you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>what a unit quaternion is</li>
<li>how we store an axis angle form in an unit quaternion</li>
<li>that there are efficient ways to convert unit quaternion rotations to rotation matrices (you don&rsquo;t need to know the methods, just that they exist)</li>
<li>that there are ways to multiply quaternions (again, you just need to know they exist) and that this corresponds to composition</li>
<li>that THREE.js uses unit quaternions internally</li>
<li>that special methods exist for interpolating quaternions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Hopefully, you now have a sense of what a Quaternion is and why we use them.</p>
