Where did you get your shader? Describe the source and include a link.
    I get from https://thebookofshaders.com/examples/.
        under the subtitle patterns.


In your own words, describe how this shader works. (3-5 sentences)
    This shader generates striped wavy lines with sharp edges. The function mirrorTile let an edge be presented on the opposite side. 
    The fucntion fillY makes the black and white colors of each section be presented in an interlaced manner.
