Explain how you made the buildings. 

I created 2 types of buildings with different roof.
    - Grhouse1 is a Rectangular cube. It has four windows in the fronts side and also a door. I make Grhouse1 by set the coordinate for each surface.
    - Grhouse2 is a square cube, with tile texture for roof. It has 5 windows in the front side with a door. Also, in its left side and right side which also has 4 windows. I make it by set the coordinate for each surface
