		<div class="content post__content clearfix"><p>There are three categories of things we need to think about:</p>
<ol>
<li>The &ldquo;science&rdquo; - how do the methods work?</li>
<li>The &ldquo;engineering&rdquo; - how do we use the methods in practice? (specifically, in a practical API)</li>
<li>The &ldquo;art&rdquo; - how do we use these to create interesting effects?</li>
</ol>
<p>For 1 (the science), we&rsquo;ll discuss how the methods work in theory in class, as well as the required readings. Make sure you understand it.</p>
<p>For 2 (the engineering), you&rsquo;ll need to see how THREE exposes the functionality - mainly by reading the THREE documentation, looking for samples on the web, and trying it out yourself. We&rsquo;ll see more of what is going on &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo; later when we start to program our own shaders.</p>
<p>For 3 (the art), you&rsquo;ll need to try it out to try to make cool looking stuff. Look for examples on the web to inspire you. In this workbook, try to focus on how to use textures to make cool appearances. You will have the opportunity to make cool shapes and motions in future workbooks. So you might want, to focus on simple objects (primitives are OK) and simple motions for this assignment.</p>
<p>The exercises in this workbook ask you to try out the features in THREE for fancy texture mapping. We would like you to try to make interesting things to explore what the different types of textures do, but the requirements are pretty minimal for each of the exercises.</p>
<p>As a warmup, and to give you something to build on in the rest of the workbook, create some real-world object with a texture in <a href="../../for_students/09-01-01.js" class="for_students">09-01-01.js</a> below. Look around and see if there&rsquo;s something you want to model: your laptop, a book, etc. This is a good opportunity to incorporate real photos in a texture.</p>
<p>(If you need a hint, you can look at the lecture 18E from 2020 <a href="https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/media/Lecture+18EA+03+29+21+-+Texture+Review/1_1720feib/199466623">video</a>, <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/files/25195468/download?download_frd=1">slides</a> where I create the textbook with textures. The example uses old-style THREE <code>Geometry</code>, but otherwise its helpful).)</p>
<p>A goal here is to use simple shapes, but more complex textures, to make an object that is interesting.</p>

<p>The first advanced thing we&rsquo;ll try is material property maps on <a href="../../docs/2/" class="Next__Page">Next: Exercise 1: Material Property Maps </a>.</p>
