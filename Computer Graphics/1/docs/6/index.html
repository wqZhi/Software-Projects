		<div class="content post__content clearfix"><p>So far, this workbook has mainly been you reading code (and html).
Hopefully, you also took the opportunity to
do some extra reading (for example, reading some JavaScript references).
And some tinkering: one way to understand the programs is to try to
make changes to see how things work.</p>
<p>On this page, we have three boxes that you need to do yourself.</p>
<p>To help you check that you are getting the concepts, here are a few
little programming things to try. In each box, we will ask you to do
something. You should edit the 
<a href="../../for_students/01-06-01.html" class="for_students">01-06-01.html</a>, <a href="../../for_students/01-06-02.html" class="for_students">01-06-02.html</a>, and <a href="../../for_students/01-06-03.html" class="for_students">01-06-03.html</a> files
accordingly to do it. These will be the things that the grader will check.</p>
<p>These little exercises are simple - and not very interesting.
But make sure you understand what you are doing, since they will
be the building blocks for doing more interesting things later.</p>
<p>And of course, to correctly use GIT to commit your work and push it
back to the repository on GitHub.</p>
<p>For this workbook, it is OK that the JavaScript code is in the HTML files.
In fact, it is preferred.</p>
<p>Note that the rubric for the boxes on this page is at the bottom. In fact, all workbook pages have the rubrics at the bottom.</p>
<h2 id="box-1-sliders">Box 1: Sliders</h2>
<p>In this box (<a href="../../for_students/01-06-01.html" class="for_students">01-06-01.html</a>), make 3 sliders. Add event handlers such that the third
slider shows the difference in value between the first two.
So that slider3 = slider2 - slider1. Slider3 should move whenever
slider1 or slider2 are moved. Making it such that slider1 and/or slider2 move
when slider3 moves is a little trickier (and worth more points) - you need to figure out how to make reasonable values for slider 1 and 2 given a new value for slider 3. Write your code in <a href="../../for_students/01-06-01.js" class="for_students">01-06-01.js</a></p>
<iframe
    title="01-06-01"
    src="../../for_students/01-06-01.html"
    class="includebox includebox-standard"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    scrolling="no"
    frameborder="0"
></iframe>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Box 3 on <a href="../../docs/4/">Page &nbsp;4&nbsp; (Doing things to HTML)</a>  is a good starting point.
The lower of the two sliders there has a nicer behavior for this exercise.
Consider setting the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>
properties of the sliders so that the third slider has the right range.
The <code>min</code> can be negative.</p>
<h2 id="box-2-start-stop">Box 2: Start Stop</h2>
<p>In this box (<a href="../../for_students/01-06-02.html" class="for_students">01-06-02.html</a>), make a slider and two buttons. One labeled &ldquo;start&rdquo; the other labeled &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.
When you press &ldquo;start&rdquo;, the slider starts moving. 
When you press &ldquo;stop&rdquo; the slider stops.
This is sortof like the last slider in Box 3 on <a href="../../docs/5/">Page &nbsp;5&nbsp; (Animation Loops)</a>, except that you should
use two buttons, rather than one checkbox. Write your code in <a href="../../for_students/01-06-02.js" class="for_students">01-06-02.js</a></p>
<iframe
    title="01-06-02"
    src="../../for_students/01-06-02.html"
    class="includebox includebox-standard"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    scrolling="no"
    frameborder="0"
></iframe>

<h2 id="box-3-bounce">Box 3: Bounce</h2>
<p>The sliders on <a href="../../docs/5/">Page &nbsp;5&nbsp; (Animation Loops)</a> all went from left to right, and then restarted at the left.</p>
<p>In this box (<a href="../../for_students/01-06-03.html" class="for_students">01-06-03.html</a>), make the slider move from left to right, but when it hits the right edge, have it move right to left. It should repeat (so it goes back and forth - as if it &ldquo;bounces&rdquo; when it hits the edge). <b>You must use a time delta</b>, as explained on <a href="../../docs/5/">Page &nbsp;5&nbsp; (Animation Loops)</a>, to control timing. Write your code in <a href="../../for_students/01-06-03.js" class="for_students">01-06-03.js</a></p>
<iframe
    title="01-06-03"
    src="../../for_students/01-06-03.html"
    class="includebox includebox-standard"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    scrolling="no"
    frameborder="0"
></iframe>

<h2 id="box-4-throb-not-blink">Box 4: Throb, not blink</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;blinking&rdquo; in Box 5 of <a href="../../docs/5/">Page &nbsp;5&nbsp; (Animation Loops)</a> is really annoying. Instead let&rsquo;s make
something a little less annoying: instead of just changing to another color
in a flash, have the color slowly (but not too slowly) change from one color to another and back. <b>There should be a continuous fade between colors, not discrete jumps.</b> It should repeat. Again, <b>you must use a time delta</b>, as explained on <a href="../../docs/5/">Page &nbsp;5&nbsp; (Animation Loops)</a>, to control timing.</p>
<p>The basic version of this would have the color go between red and white. This is basically the same as Box 3, except that rather than changing the position of the slider, you are changing the background color of the text (or the blue and green components of the color).</p>
<p>The box below is <a href="../../for_students/01-06-04.html" class="for_students">01-06-04.html</a> Write your code in <a href="../../for_students/01-06-04.js" class="for_students">01-06-04.js</a></p>
<iframe
    title="01-06-04"
    src="../../for_students/01-06-04.html"
    class="includebox includebox-standard"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    scrolling="no"
    frameborder="0"
></iframe>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> To move between two numbers a and b, you can weigh them with a parameter t which goes between 0 and 1, and the formula t*a + (1-t)*b. If you plug in t=0, you get b, and if you plug in t=1, you get a. If you plug in a value in between, you get some weighted value in between a and b. For example, t=0.5 gives you 0.5*a + 0.5*b = (a+b)/2, which is the average of the two. This concept is called <strong>linear interpolation</strong>, and we&rsquo;ll cover it more later in the class.</p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> We&rsquo;ve been using HTML colors as hex (so red is #FF0000).
You&rsquo;ll may want to do your math with regular numbers and convert.

is a reference page that might be useful. 
Or, you might find a more convenient way to specify colors using numbers. Also see <a href="https://pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp22/tutorials/color/" target="_blank">CS559 Color Tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re done with your work, remember to commit everything and push it back to GitHub. And, when you&rsquo;re done, don&rsquo;t forget to do the &ldquo;handin survey&rdquo; on Canvas (<a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/293042/assignments/1448849">Workbook 1 Handin (due Mon, Jan 31)</a>) that tells us that your assignment is ready to be graded.</p>
