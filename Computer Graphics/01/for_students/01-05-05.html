        Also, we will often put all of our "changes" into a single function, so there
        is only one <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>. That function might call other functions.
    </p>
    <p>
        And, since we don't know how fast the loop will go (since the browser might do some
        work between calls, or the stuff we do might take some time), we need to look at the
        actual "clock time" to make sure that things go at the right speed.

        Here's a silly example where we make something blink (the hard way). The trick is that we want to change color every 250ms (not faster).
        Look at the code.
        <span id="span1">Some text to blink</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        OK, that was horrible. Let's try to see if
        <span id="span2">this is any better?</span>
        Or, maybe <span id="span3">even this one</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Those are all really annoying looking - You can try something better
        on the next page...
