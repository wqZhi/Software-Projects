            Here is the button example (01-03-02) again. Just that this time the script is 
            in a different place.
            <button id="button1">Button 1</button>
            You should look at the HTML to see the JavaScript right inline on the button.
            You should see what the button does (get used to looking at the console!).
        </p>
    </body>

    <script type="module" defer>
        let button = document.getElementById("button1");
        button.onclick = function() {
            console.log("Button 1 Pressed!");
        }
    </script>
</html>
