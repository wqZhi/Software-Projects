    Just like buttons, sliders generate different kinds of events.
    With each of these sliders, we are catching a different event.
    See if you can figure out the difference.

<div>
    <input id="box3-slider1" type="range" min="0" max="100" step="1"><br />
    <input id="box3-slider2" type="range" min="0" max="100" step="1"><br />
    <input id="box3-slider3" type="range" min="0" max="100" step="1"><br />
</div>
<ul>
        <li id="box3-li1">Slider 1 was not used yet</li>
        <li id="box3-li2">Slider 2 was not used yet</li>
        <li id="box3-li3">Slider 3 was not used yet</li>
</ul>
