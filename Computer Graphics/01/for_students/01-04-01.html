    JavaScript has complete access to the web page. It can read and write to it.
    To make this easier, we need to name parts so we can find them.
    So, we can <span id="span1">put text into the HTML that you won't see!</span>
    We can <span id="span2">put text that we re-style.</span>
    And we can put a <button id="button1">Button</button> here too, 
    that we will make write something to the console. 
    And here is a <button id="button2">Button</button> that does something else.
    <span id="span3"></span>
